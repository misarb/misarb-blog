## About 

My name is Lahcen, and I work as a Software Engineer with a strong passion for programming languages such as Rust, C, Python, and most recently, Mojo.

I've established this blog as a platform for sharing content on topics that I find fascinating or projects I've developed and wish to share with others.

My blog covers a wide range of subjects, including Embedded Systems, Automotive Protocol Simulators, ADAS, and various other topics that pique my interest.

If you enjoyed the content of this blog, _or not_, feel free to reach out to me
 
I welcome further discussions on various topics and value any feedback you may have.
